I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Prof. [Yingcong Chen](https://www.yingcong.me) and Prof. [Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io).

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering from Sun Yat-Sen University at 2019 and my M.Sc. Degree in Information Technology from HKUST at 2020. 

From July 2020 to Sept. 2021, I joined SmartMore as a Product Manager and an Algorithm Engineer. I also experienced a 3-month game development internship at NetEase in 2018, a fun period.
