I'm currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Prof. [Yingcong Chen](https://www.yingcong.me) and Prof. [Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io). Currently, I concentrate my studies on computer vision and AIGC, and expect to graduate in October, 2025.

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering from Sun Yat-Sen University in 2019 and my M.Sc. Degree in Information Technology from HKUST in 2020. 

From July 2020 to Sept. 2021, I joined SmartMore as a Product Manager and an Algorithm Engineer. I also experienced a 3-month game development internship at NetEase in 2018, a fun period.
